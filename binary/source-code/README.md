# Source Code
Difficulty of the challenge is 3/5.</br>
NOTE: Only give participants the exe file</br></br>
They say that using python to create executables is bad. Do you know why?


## Writeup
Decompile the exe using a pyinstaller extractor. Then use uncompyle6 to decompile the pyc file to find the flag in the source code.

```flag is HNF{H0w_d1D_y0u_se3_my_5OURc3_k0D3}```
